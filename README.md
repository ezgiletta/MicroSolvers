Rohde &amp; Schwarz - HackaTUM2022 - Challenge 2

## What it does?
-  **Triplet loss** to encourages dissimilar alignments be distant from similar alignments
-  Siamese network and triplet loss can be combined with different input types. For example; as in the previous slide, the rotation change is more understandable in sliced MIP data. Thus, feature extraction phase can be more successful.

## How we built it?
Step by step:
1. Data Analysis
2. Data Load
3. Design
4. Training
5. Validation
6. Repeat â€“ 3

## Challenges we ran into
-  Generalization on the unseen radar sensors
-  Understanding data in short notice

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-  Ideas that we bring into table
-  Teamwork
-  Free swag that we collected

## What we learned
-  It is our first experience with the Microwave Imaging dataset
-  We get to know new companies and people

## What's next for
-  Improving the Augmentation methods
-  Working on different approaches for generalize the network better to get accurate alignment 
results on the unseen radar sensors
